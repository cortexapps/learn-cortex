  failureMessage: "# About\nThis scorecard rule will walk you through learning AWS\
    \ for Cortex.\n\n# Setup\n- Sign up for a [free tier AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?p=ft&c=hp&z=6&refid=78b916d7-7c94-4cab-98d9-0ce5e648dd5f).\n\
    \n- You will be prompted for a credit card.  We recommend using a virtual credit\
    \ card service like privacy.com.  Create a virtual credit card with a $1 total\
    \ spend limit.  Amazon indicates they may put a temporary $1 hold on your account\
    \ to prove who you are.\n\n- Follow the Cortex [documentation](https://docs.cortex.io/docs/reference/integrations/aws)\
    \ for configuring the AWS integration.\n\n- Make sure you have enabled [automatic\
    \ import of AWS entities](https://docs.cortex.io/docs/reference/integrations/aws#enable-automatic-import-of-aws-entities).\
    \  Not required if you complete end up manually importing entities (details below),\
    \ but will be helpful for ongoing updates in your workspace.\n\n## Create an S3\
    \ bucket via the AWS console\n- Login to the AWS console.  This should be a URL\
    \ of the form https://<account id>.signin.aws.amazon.com/console.\n\n- Search\
    \ for S3 in the search.\n\n- Click on S3 to go to the Simple Storage Service (S3)\
    \ page.\n\n- Click on the \"Create Bucket\" button.\n\n- Give the bucket a unique\
    \ name.  The bucket name needs to be unique, so recommend a format like <firstName>-<lastName>-learn-cortex-bucket.\n\
    \n- Click on the add tag button.\n\n- Set key = service, value = learn-cortex.\n\
    \n- Optional: click on the add tag button again.\n\n- Set key = owner, value =\
    \ <x-cortex-tag for any team entity in your workspace>.\n\n# Task\n\n- AWS entities\
    \ are synced daily in Cortex, but you can force a manual sync.\n    - Catalogs\
    \ -> All Entities -> Import Entities -> Import Discovered Entities -> AWS -> Sync\
    \ Entities.\n    - Click on your S3 bucket.\n    - Confirm Import\n- You should\
    \ end up with an AWS::S3::Bucket entity resembling the following entity YAML:\n\
    \    \n```\nopenapi: 3.0.1\ninfo:\n  title: jeff-schnitter-learn-cortex\n  x-cortex-tag:\
    \ jeff-schnitter-learn-cortex\n  x-cortex-type: AWS::S3::Bucket\n  x-cortex-infra:\n\
    \    aws:\n      cloudControl:\n      - type: AWS::S3::Bucket\n        region:\
    \ us-east-1\n        accountId: \"331409392944\"\n        identifier: jeff-schnitter-learn-cortex\n\
    ```\n\n- Outgoing dependencies are synced separately.\n- Navigate to the [relationship\
    \ graph](https://app.getcortexapp.com/admin/graph) -> 3 dots -> Sync dependencies.\n\
    - Navigate to the Learn Cortex entity\n- You should see an outgoing dependencies\
    \ for the Learn Cortex entity that references your S3 bucket.\n\n![Learn Cortex\

    \n# CQL Rule\nThe CQL rule for this rule verifies that the \"Learn Cortex\" has\
    \ an outgoing dependency of type \"AWS::S3::Bucket\"."
