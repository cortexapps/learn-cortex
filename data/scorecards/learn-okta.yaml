    # About
    This scorecard rule will walk you through setting up and testing the [Okta integration](https://docs.cortex.io/docs/reference/integrations/okta) for Cortex.

    # Set up
    Create a free Okta dev account at https://developer.okta.com/signup/.

    ## Configure the integration in Cortex

    ### Gotchas
    - Don't copy the OKTA URL from the browser.    It should not contain the string "-admin".  For more details, go to https://bit.ly/finding-okta-domain.

    - I wasn't prompted to define any scopes for the API token and didn't define any.
    - I really don't know what group types are and didn't define any when defining the integration in Cortex.
